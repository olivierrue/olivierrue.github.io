I am Bioinformatics Engineer at INRAE. I am working on the Migale bioinformatics facility. I am specialized in analyzing metagenomics data (metagenetics, shotgun metagenomics and metatranscriptomics).

I am the head of the <a href="https://migale.inrae.fr/data-analysis">data analysis service</a> offered by the Migale facility.
